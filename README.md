# ECE 2524 Project 3


## Project Description
`pygrep` is a grep-like utility written in Python. It provides some of the features of the `grep` built into Unix systems, but this one is written in Python.

## Usage
`python pygrep.py `
Since this Python script is executable, it can also be run by running `./pygrep.py`.
